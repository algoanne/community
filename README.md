Suggestions
-------------


### goal 

- should have example uses on autogen'd docs pages 
- should allow remote algod/indexer endpoints

### sandbox 

- should be able to "freeze" and "restore" to known state (private node only)
- should make it easier to have multiple instances running

### getting started docs

- should have a number of canonical examples. start with a hello world first, increase in difficulty final example should be full auction app
- should have example applications that can be cloned down and created for testing purposes

### pyteal

- should allow definition of complex data types (lists, sets, maps, structs)
- should provide an abstract class to subclass for smart contracts/signatures
- ABI methods produce IDL for generating a client
### SDKs

- provide a min balance function either SDK or apis
- provide an arbitrary sign/verify bytes (no MX prefix as domain separator) 
- Read IDL and produce a client which works well with SDKs 

### Community Projects

- Awesome Algorand repo with open source community projects
